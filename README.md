# MyReads Project

I created this project as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree.

This app helps the user keep track of books sorted into three shelves: "currently reading", "want to read", and "read". It allows the user to transfer books between shelves, remove books, and add books by search via the backend API provided by Udacity.
